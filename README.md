# Will's Favorite Movie Trailers
The purpose of this website is to display my favorite movies along with their poster art and trailers.
Scroll to see the all the titles and art of different movies; click on them to view the trailer.

## How to Run
Steps:
* Modify the movie instances in media.py. You can change the movie titles, image urls and youtube trailer urls.
* Run entretainment_center.py; this will create the website to be displayed. At the end of entretainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies). This calls on fresh_tomatoes.py to edit the html file and display the website using webbrowser.
